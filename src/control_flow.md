# Control Flow

## For-In Loops

```swift
let names = ["Anna", "Alex", "Brian", "Jack"]
for name in names {
    print("Hello, \(name)!")
}
// Hello, Anna!
// Hello, Alex!
// Hello, Brian!
// Hello, Jack!


for index in 1...5 {
    print("\(index) times 5 is \(index * 5)")
}
// 1 times 5 is 5
// 2 times 5 is 10
// 3 times 5 is 15
// 4 times 5 is 20
// 5 times 5 is 25

```

```swift
let base = 3
let power = 10
var answer = 1
for _ in 1...power {
    answer *= base
}
print("\(base) to the power of \(power) is \(answer)")
// Prints "3 to the power of 10 is 59049"

```

```swift

let minutes = 60
for tickMark in 0..<minutes {
    // render the tick mark each minute (60 times)
}

let minuteInterval = 5
for tickMark in stride(from: 0, to: minutes, by: minuteInterval) {
    // render the tick mark every 5 minutes (0, 5, 10, 15 ... 45, 50, 55)
}


let hours = 12
let hourInterval = 3
for tickMark in stride(from: 3, through: hours, by: hourInterval) {
    // render the tick mark every 3 hours (3, 6, 9, 12)
}
```

## While Loops

```swift
var square = 0
var diceRoll = 0
while square < finalSquare {
    // roll the dice
    diceRoll += 1
    if diceRoll == 7 { diceRoll = 1 }
    // move by the rolled amount
    square += diceRoll
    if square < board.count {
        // if we're still on the board, move up or down for a snake or a ladder
        square += board[square]
    }
}
print("Game over!")
```

## Repeat While

```swift
repeat {
    // move up or down for a snake or ladder
    square += board[square]
    // roll the dice
    diceRoll += 1
    if diceRoll == 7 { diceRoll = 1 }
    // move by the rolled amount
    square += diceRoll
} while square < finalSquare
print("Game over!")

```

## Conditional Statements

### if

```swift
var temperatureInFahrenheit = 30
if temperatureInFahrenheit <= 32 {
    print("It's very cold. Consider wearing a scarf.")
}
// Prints "It's very cold. Consider wearing a scarf."


temperatureInFahrenheit = 40
if temperatureInFahrenheit <= 32 {
    print("It's very cold. Consider wearing a scarf.")
} else {
    print("It's not that cold. Wear a T-shirt.")
}
// Prints "It's not that cold. Wear a T-shirt."


temperatureInFahrenheit = 90
if temperatureInFahrenheit <= 32 {
    print("It's very cold. Consider wearing a scarf.")
} else if temperatureInFahrenheit >= 86 {
    print("It's really warm. Don't forget to wear sunscreen.")
} else {
    print("It's not that cold. Wear a T-shirt.")
}
// Prints "It's really warm. Don't forget to wear sunscreen."

```

```swift
let weatherAdvice = if temperatureInCelsius <= 0 {
    "It's very cold. Consider wearing a scarf."
} else if temperatureInCelsius >= 30 {
    "It's really warm. Don't forget to wear sunscreen."
} else {
    "It's not that cold. Wear a T-shirt."
}


print(weatherAdvice)
// Prints "It's not that cold. Wear a T-shirt."
```

## Switch

```swift
let someCharacter: Character = "z"
switch someCharacter {
case "a":
    print("The first letter of the Latin alphabet")
case "z":
    print("The last letter of the Latin alphabet")
default:
    print("Some other character")
}
// Prints "The last letter of the Latin alphabet"
```

```swift
let anotherCharacter: Character = "a"
switch anotherCharacter {
case "a", "A":
    print("The letter A")
default:
    print("Not the letter A")
}
// Prints "The letter A"

```

## Interval Matching

```swift
let approximateCount = 62
let countedThings = "moons orbiting Saturn"
let naturalCount: String
switch approximateCount {
case 0:
    naturalCount = "no"
case 1..<5:
    naturalCount = "a few"
case 5..<12:
    naturalCount = "several"
case 12..<100:
    naturalCount = "dozens of"
case 100..<1000:
    naturalCount = "hundreds of"
default:
    naturalCount = "many"
}
print("There are \(naturalCount) \(countedThings).")
// Prints "There are dozens of moons orbiting Saturn."


```

### Tuples

```swift
let somePoint = (1, 1)
switch somePoint {
case (0, 0):
    print("\(somePoint) is at the origin")
case (_, 0):
    print("\(somePoint) is on the x-axis")
case (0, _):
    print("\(somePoint) is on the y-axis")
case (-2...2, -2...2):
    print("\(somePoint) is inside the box")
default:
    print("\(somePoint) is outside of the box")
}
// Prints "(1, 1) is inside the box"
```

### Value Bindings

```swift
let anotherPoint = (2, 0)
switch anotherPoint {
case (let x, 0):
    print("on the x-axis with an x value of \(x)")
case (0, let y):
    print("on the y-axis with a y value of \(y)")
case let (x, y):
    print("somewhere else at (\(x), \(y))")
}
// Prints "on the x-axis with an x value of 2"

```

### Where

```swift
let yetAnotherPoint = (1, -1)
switch yetAnotherPoint {
case let (x, y) where x == y:
    print("(\(x), \(y)) is on the line x == y")
case let (x, y) where x == -y:
    print("(\(x), \(y)) is on the line x == -y")
case let (x, y):
    print("(\(x), \(y)) is just some arbitrary point")
}
// Prints "(1, -1) is on the line x == -y"

```

### Compound Cases

```swift
let someCharacter: Character = "e"
switch someCharacter {
case "a", "e", "i", "o", "u":
    print("\(someCharacter) is a vowel")
case "b", "c", "d", "f", "g", "h", "j", "k", "l", "m",
    "n", "p", "q", "r", "s", "t", "v", "w", "x", "y", "z":
    print("\(someCharacter) is a consonant")
default:
    print("\(someCharacter) isn't a vowel or a consonant")
}
// Prints "e is a vowel"
```

## Control Transfer Statements

- continue

- break

- fallthrough

- return

- throw

## Early Exit

```swift
func greet(person: [String: String]) {
    guard let name = person["name"] else {
        return
    }


    print("Hello \(name)!")


    guard let location = person["location"] else {
        print("I hope the weather is nice near you.")
        return
    }


    print("I hope the weather is nice in \(location).")
}


greet(person: ["name": "John"])
// Prints "Hello John!"
// Prints "I hope the weather is nice near you."
greet(person: ["name": "Jane", "location": "Cupertino"])
// Prints "Hello Jane!"
// Prints "I hope the weather is nice in Cupertino."

```

## Deferred Actions

```swift

var score = 1
if score < 10 {
    defer {
        print(score)
    }
    score += 5
}
// Prints "6"

```

## Checking API Availability

```swift
if #available(iOS 10, macOS 10.12, *) {
    // Use iOS 10 APIs on iOS, and use macOS 10.12 APIs on macOS
} else {
    // Fall back to earlier iOS and macOS APIs
}



@available(macOS 10.12, *)
struct ColorPreference {
    var bestColor = "blue"
}


func chooseBestColor() -> String {
    guard #available(macOS 10.12, *) else {
       return "gray"
    }
    let colors = ColorPreference()
    return colors.bestColor
}
```
